# Client

## Install the Application: `npm install`

1. Clone the source code.
2. Use the command line terminal and navigate to the client directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

## Launch the Application in Development Mode: `npm start`

1. Use the command line terminal and navigate to the client directory.
2. Run `npm start` to run the client in development mode.
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Test the Application: `npm test`

1. Use the command line terminal and navigate to the client directory.
2. Run `npm test` to launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Build the Application: `npm run build`

1. Use the command line terminal and navigate to the client directory.
2. Run `npm run build` to build the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Change the Build Tool and Configuration Choices: `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!**

If you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time by running `npm run eject` in the client directory. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.
